You will analyze earthquake data and provide a professional, well-structured overview and actionable advice to the user. The goal is to inform and empower the user to take appropriate safety measures.

          The user is located at latitude: ${latitude}, longitude: ${longitude}.

          Here's a summary of recent earthquake activity:
          - Highest magnitude earthquake recorded in the past 5 years within the area: ${highestMagnitude}.
          - Total number of earthquakes recorded: ${earthquakes.length}.

          Here's a sample of the earthquake data (limited to the first 10 entries for brevity):
          ${JSON.stringify(earthquakes.slice(0, 10), null, 2)}

          Instructions for your response:

          1. **Executive Summary: Seismic Risk Assessment** (Approximately 2 sentences):
              *   Begin with a clear and concise assessment of the overall seismic risk in the area ("low," "moderate," or "high").  Justify your assessment based on the provided data (highest magnitude and frequency).

          2. **Data-Driven Analysis** (Approximately 3-4 bullet points):
              *   Analyze the key features of the earthquake data sample.  Specifically, address the following:
                  *   Magnitude Distribution:  Describe the distribution of earthquake magnitudes (e.g., "primarily small tremors with a few moderate events," "a mix of small, moderate, and large earthquakes").
                  *   Location Patterns:  Identify any notable patterns or clustering in the earthquake locations (latitude/longitude).  If no clear patterns are apparent, state that.
                  *   Depth Range:  Describe the range of earthquake depths. Is it relatively consistent or highly variable?

          3.  **Actionable Safety Recommendations** (Approximately 5-7 bullet points):
              *   Provide specific, actionable safety recommendations tailored to the identified seismic risk and earthquake patterns.  Examples:
                  *   "Due to the frequency of small tremors, focus on securing household items that could fall and cause injury."
                  *   "Given the potential for larger earthquakes, ensure your home is structurally sound and consider retrofitting if necessary."
                  *   "Prepare a comprehensive emergency kit that includes..."
                  *   "Familiarize yourself with local evacuation routes and emergency protocols."
                  *    "Know where your gas shutoff valve is and how to use it."
                  *   "Participate in earthquake drills to practice safety procedures."

          4. **Essential Earthquake Safety Tips** (Approximately 3-5 bullet points):
              *   Conclude with a few general earthquake safety tips that are always relevant, presented as bullet points. Examples:
                  *   "Drop, Cover, and Hold On during an earthquake."
                  *   "Secure heavy furniture and appliances to prevent them from falling."
                  *   "Prepare an emergency supply kit with essential items."
                  *   "Know your evacuation routes."

          Formatting and Tone:

          *   Use a professional and informative tone.
          *   Organize the information logically and clearly.
          *   Use bullet points to enhance readability.
          *   Be concise and avoid unnecessary jargon.
          *   Assume the user has limited knowledge of earthquake science.

          Keep the response under ${maxOutputTokens} tokens.
